If you're a developer we suggest that you sign up for an account, create a site and then check out the docs on the Blutui Courier tool. The Courier tool will allow you to sync your Blutui projects to your local machine where you can work on them. As you're working your projects are synced with the Blutui servers so you can see how your sites will display.

If you’re an agency, set up your account and begin inviting your development team into your organisation. From there they can start building your client's sites in Blutui. Once a site is ready to go you can share it with your client via a staging link and on go live provide access to the client to the site dashboard.
