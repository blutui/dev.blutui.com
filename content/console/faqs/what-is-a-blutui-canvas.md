Canvases are pre-built sites that you can use as a starting point for your next project. Built using best practice, you can use Canvas to help you get comfortable with the best way to build in Blutui. Alternatively, if you would like to fully customise your templates to meet your client’s brief, you can do so without using Blutui Canvas.
