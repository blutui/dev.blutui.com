With Blutui your site remains in staging mode until you publish it. If you publish a site without first configuring a custom domain the site will go live on the Blutui domain. For example if your site is called `EXAMPLE` your site will be hosted at `example`.blutui.com.

You can add as many custom domains to a site as you like the process is as follows:
- Ensure you have a paid account to add custom domains
- Add and verify your domain in the Blutui Agency Console
- Check the domain is connected via the Blutui Agency Console
- Publish your site

You can also add secondary domains to your site and they will be automatically redirected to your primary domain and secured.

Once the domain is verified and site published, Blutui will automatically source a SSL certificate for your site and add it to the domain in preparation for go live.
