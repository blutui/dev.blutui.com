How Blutui staging site works is the site you develop. Until published your site is just in staging. 

### What to do with staging site or cassette

When you build your Blutui site, a staging environment is automatically created at [your-site].blutui.com. This staging URL is where you can view your site as it develops when new code is pushed.

If you need to share a specific, non-active cassette, click the ⋯ (options) button next to the cassette to access its unique preview link.

If you want to share the site without granting admin access, you will also need to provide the site’s Password, which can be found in the Security tab of the site settings.
