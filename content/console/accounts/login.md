## Login to Blutui

The login button can be found on the Blutui Home Page in the top right corner next to the `sign up` button. Here you will be prompted for your email & password for your Blutui account. We also offer Github Single Sign On and Google Single Sign On. Once logged in, you will be taken to the Agency Console where you can manage your site(s).

Alternatively, if you have not yet created an account, you can do so by clicking the `sign up` button. All you need is an email address and a password.
