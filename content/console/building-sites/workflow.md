## **Introduction**

### **What is Blutui?**

Blutui is a Content Management System (CMS) built for the creative industry with the goal of providing Front-End Developers with design freedom. Your designers use their favourite tools within the Blutui platform and the agency dashboard provides clarity for account managers and clients. We take care of the backend, so you can focus on what matters; your content.

To find out more about Blutui's pricing and subscriptions, head to our [Pricing Page](https://blutui.com/pricing 'Blutui Pricing') or our [Accounts](/agency/getting-started/accounts/organisations 'Blutui Accounts') docs.

## **Choose a Starting Point**

### **Whether you are an Agency Owner, Front-End Developer, Content Manager or Client, Blutui is the perfect CMS for you**

Front-End Developers are responsible for coding and creating the visual front-end elements of your Blutui website. If you are a developer, you will need to learn how to start building sites on Blutui. Find out more about this and all necessary installations below.

If you are an Agency Owner, Content Manager or Client, you do not need to worry about installation as you will spend most of your time on the site dashboard where you will manage things such as assets, blogs and collections. Learn more about the site dashboard [here.](agency/agency-console/console-basics/the-agency-console 'Site Dashboard')
