## Billing
You can view your billing details at any point from your organisation’s drop down box. In order to maintain an active Blutui account you must keep a valid credit card on file.

- Blutui will charge all fees to the card on file, this card will be charged for any additional services or purchases such as domains or images.
- If the card fails your sites will remain online and your collaborators, site owners and content managers will remain associated with your accounts.
- Blutui provides a 4 week period to correct any billing issues before services are disrupted.
- You will be notified by email if there are any problems with your billing.
- If service is interrupted for billing reasons it will be restored as soon as the billing issue is resolved.
- Any overdue fees will be charged as soon as a billing issue is resolved
