Blutui is the proprietary platform developed specifically to unify the creative industry using the most cutting edge technology. Given the wide variety of CMS platforms on the market and the myriad templates, plugins and languages used we do not yet offer an automated migration pathway. Keep an eye out for any future development however.
It's easy to point your domain at our servers and switch from your current site to your newly built Blutui site instantly. Migrating sites from one platform to another can affect search engine rankings. More information on best SEO practice for migrating sites is available here.
