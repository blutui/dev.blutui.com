## How to edit videos

Canopy's user-friendly interface makes editing videos a smooth process.

### Here's how to get started

{% step title="Locate the Video" position="1" %}
Identify the video you want to edit on your page. Canopy uses visual indicators like highlighted areas or bounding boxes to show editable elements.

Alternatively, you can also employ one of the following methods to locate your editable items.

- Click the **Toggle Guides** button to visually highlight all editable regions on the page.
- Utilize the **Component Tree** to navigate and identify the specific text element within the page structure.

{% step title="Edit in the Sidebar" position="3" %}
Once selected, a sidebar will appear on the right side of the interface. This sidebar will display the editing options for the chosen video element.

**Type:** Enter the MIME type of your video file in this textbox.

Common video formats include:

- video/mp4 (MP4)
- video/webm (WebM)
- video/ogg (Ogg)

It's important to choose the appropriate MIME type for your video file to ensure proper playback across different browsers.

**URL:** Enter the complete web address (URL) of your video file in this textbox.
