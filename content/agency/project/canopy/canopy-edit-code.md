## How to edit code blocks

Canopy's intuitive interface makes editing code blocks a breeze

### Here's how to get started

{% step title="Locate the Code Block" position="1" %}
Identify the code block you want to modify on your page. Canopy uses visual indicators like highlighted areas or bounding boxes to show editable elements.

Alternatively, you can also employ one of the following methods to locate your editable items.

- Click the **Toggle Guides** button to visually highlight all editable regions on the page.
- Utilize the **Component Tree** to navigate and identify the specific text element within the page structure.

**Language:** Select the appropriate language that corresponds to your code snippet.

**Code:** Paste or type your code snippet here.
