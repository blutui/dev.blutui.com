## How to edit buttons

Canopy's intuitive editor makes editing buttons a simple process

### Here's how to get started

{% step title="Locate the Button" position="1" %}
Identify the button you want to modify on your page. Canopy uses visual cues like highlighted areas or bounding boxes to show editable elements.

Alternatively, you can also employ one of the following methods to locate your editable items.

- Click the **Toggle Guides** button to visually highlight all editable regions on the page.
- Utilize the **Component Tree** to navigate and identify the specific text element within the page structure.

{% step title="Edit in the Sidebar" position="3" %}
Once selected, a sidebar will appear on the right side of the interface. This sidebar will display the editing options for the chosen button element.

**Label:** Enter the text you want displayed on the button in this textbox. This is the primary text users will see and interact with.

**URL:** Enter the in page path or complete web address (URL) of the webpage you want the button to link to.

**Open in new tab:** Select this checkbox if you want the linked webpage to open in a new browser tab when the button is clicked.

{% step title="Make Your Changes" position="4" %}
Simply modify the content directly within the sidebar. The changes will be reflected in real-time on the actual page, allowing you to preview your edits as you go. When you're happy with the changes click on **Update** to save the changes.
