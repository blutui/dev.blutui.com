### Individual Form Fields

To create a field in the form, click on one of the grey bars.

Once you’ve created a field in the form, you have to give it a label & a name. The label is what the user sees, the name is what the template refers to - it will be beneficial to give your field a unique name to help identify it. You can also add instructional help text to your form template through the ‘Help Text’ box. This is there to help users understand the purpose of your form, and to help them fill it out successfully.

| Text      | This field can be used when you need the user to enter one line of text into a form. An example of this might be: `Your Name.`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Text Area | Instead of a single line, like above, it is a box of text. An example of this might be when asking for a review.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Email     | Use this field when asking for an email address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Phone     | Use this field when asking for a phone number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Number    | Use this when asking for a number figure. An example of this might be when asking                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| File      | Use this field when asking for file uploads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Select    | This provides you with the option of a drop down field which requires the user to select one option only. This field has an ‘Options’ section down the bottom. You can add as many options as you like when using this field.                                                                                                                                                               |
| Hidden    | We recommend using this field as it is used to help protect against robots. The basic idea is to provide an extra input field which is hidden to a user when viewed normally from the browser. This means if you check your form data when a submission is being processed, you can determine if the field is still empty. If it is filled out, then a bot must have auto filled the field. |
