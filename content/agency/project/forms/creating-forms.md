## Introduction 
The forms tab can be found in the navigation menu on the right hand side of the Site Dashboard landing page. When clicking on this tab, you will be redirected to a new page where you will find any of your sites form submissions on the panel on the right hand side of the page (where the navigation menu was prior). Clicking into these forms will allow you to see the individual form submissions.

## Create Form
To create a new form, click the `Create form` button at the bottom of the left hand side panel. A prompt will appear that will ask you to fill out the name of the form, the form handle and the default HTML template your form will use. 

The name of the form is what the user will see & the handle is the unique identifier. When referring to the template - this is what is used to drive the look and feel of the form. Your template is created by your agency.

Once you have filled these fields out, click `create form` and you’re ready to go.

The right hand panel has the following four sections:

## reCAPTCHA

reCAPTCHA is Google’s spam protection service that protects your website from fraud and abuse. Implementing reCAPTCHA must be done in the template; your agency can implement this if requested. We recommend this to be used wherever possible. 

To edit and update the reCAPTCHA codes, go to the `Settings` then click the `Forms` button which will give you a place to add the `Public Key` and `Secret Key` then hit the Save button to update reCAPTCHA.
