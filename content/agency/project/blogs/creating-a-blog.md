## Introduction

## What’s the difference between a blog and a post?

The blogs tab can be found second from the top of the navigation menu on the right hand side of the Site Dashboard landing page. 

When landing on the first screen, you will see that there are two options - posts or blogs.

You are also able to see the name of the post, the author, the date it was published and which blog the post is a part of. If you click on the link under ‘title,’ it will direct you to the blog editor. 

## Create a New Blog
