## Uploading Files

There are two options if you would like to upload a file as an asset. Option one is to click the `Upload Files` button underneath the Assets heading, and option two is to click the blue circular icon in the bottom right hand corner of the page.

## Searching for Assets

Search for assets using the search bar located near the top right hand corner of the Assets page. As long as you know what the name of the asset is, it is only one search away.
