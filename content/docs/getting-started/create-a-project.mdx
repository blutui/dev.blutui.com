## Creating your first project

With Blutui you can create an unlimited number of development projects. A development project is a free password protected website only accessible using the project's development password. When you are ready to publish your project to the world, a recurring monthly fee will apply. Before we get started, you will need a [Blutui account](https://auth.blutui.com/register).

## What's Next? Setup Blutui Courier

Now that your project is set up in Blutui, the next crucial step is to prepare your local development environment. You'll need the Blutui Courier command-line tool to pull your project files, make local changes, and push them back to the Blutui platform.
