description: 'Start building your Blutui project with confidence.'

Now that you have scaffolded your Blutui project and understand the folder structure, you are ready to build your site.
Depending on the starter canvas you chose during the **courier create** step, you will need to run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

to install all necessary dependencies and start the development server.

After which on a different terminal you can run:

```bash
courier dev
```

to start your development server on `https://localhost:8080/`.

<Callout>
  Courier only tracks changes after you have run the development server and only tracks changes in the **public** and
  **views** directories. Any changes made outside these directories will not be included
</Callout>

Let's edit the **index.canvas** page and add the following code.

```canvas {% process=false filename="pages/index.canvas" %}
{% extends 'templates/default' %}

{% block body %}
    <h1>Hello blutui</h1>
    {{ cms_text('text-tag', { value: 'Editable text content.' }) }}
{% endblock %}
```

Reload your browser and you should see the text on your page.

<Callout>
The **cms_text** function is a **Canopy** element, which are editable pieces of content on your site. These are defined by developers in code and can be edited by content editors on the dashboard.

Learn more about [cms-text](/docs/canvas/functions/canopy/cms-text).

</Callout>

Once you're happy with your changes, run

```bash
courier push
```

to push your changes.

Your project will be available on your **staging site** at
`https://[project-handel].blutui.com`
