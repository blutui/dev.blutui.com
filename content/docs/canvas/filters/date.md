title: 'date'
description: 'The date filter formats a date to a given format.'
---

```canvas {% process=false %}
{{ post.published_at | date('m/d/Y') }}
```

For more information on how to [format](#format) a date see the table below.

The **date** filter accepts strings. For instance, to display the current date, filter the word "now":

```canvas {% process=false %}
{{ 'now' | date('m/d/Y') }}
```

To escape words and characters in the date format use `\\` in front of each character:

```canvas {% process=false %}
{{ post.published_at | date('F jS \\a\\t g:ia') }}
```

If the value passed to the **date** filter is `null`, it will return the current date by default. If an empty string is desired instead of the current date, use a ternary operator:

```canvas {% process=false %}
{{ post.published_at is empty ? '' : post.published_at | date('m/d/Y') }}
```

If no format is provided, Canvas will use: `F j, Y H:i`

## Timezone

By default, the date is displayed by applying the default timezone, but you can override it by explicitly specifying a timezone:

```canvas {% process=false %}
{{ post.published_at | date('m/d/Y', 'Europe/Paris') }}
```
