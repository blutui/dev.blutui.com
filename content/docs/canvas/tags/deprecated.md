title: 'deprecated'
---

This page is generally useful to Canvas template developers. Canvas generates a deprecation notice where the **deprecated** tag is used in a template:

```canvas {% process=false>
{# base.html #}
{% deprecated 'The "base.html" template is deprecated, use "layout.html" instead.>
{% extends 'layout.html'>
```

Also you can deprecate a block in the following way:

```canvas {% process=false>
{% block hey>
  {% deprecated 'The "hey" block is deprecated, use "greet" instead.'>
  {{ block('greet') }}
{% endblock>

{% block greet>
  Hey you!
{% endblock>
```

Note that by default, the deprecation notices are silenced and never displayed nor logged.
