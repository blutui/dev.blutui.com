Collections are the primary method for managing structured data within Blutui. They allow you to define reusable data schemas using a wide range of field types. This makes it easy to create dynamic, flexible content such as staff profiles, product listings etc that can be managed directly from the dashboard without touching code.

## Creating your first collection

1. Open your project from the Blutui Agency Console.

2. Navigate to **Collections** in the sidebar.

3. Click **Create collection** to start a new one.

### Define your fields
When creating a collection, you must define the fields that will hold your content data. 

Each field requires a **Display Name** (label) and a **Attribute Name** (used in code).

For this example, we will create a `Staff` collection with the following fields:

| Field    | Display Name | Attribute Name |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Text     | Name          | name          |
| Text Area| Biography     | bio           |
| Image    | Photo         | photo         |

The **Attribute Name** is used in your code to reference the field.

### Create a Canvas template for your collection

Once your collection is set up, you can display it on your site using a Canvas template.

1. Inside your project’s **views** directory, create a new folder called **components** (if it doesn’t already exist).
2. Inside it, create a file named **staff.canvas**.

Your file structure should look like this:

```
views/
└── components/
    └── staff.canvas
```

add the following Canvas code

```twig tab="staff.canvas"
{% set collection = cms.collection('staff') %}

{% for entry in collection %}
  <div>
    <img src="{{ entry.photo }}" alt="{{ entry.name }}" />
    <h2>{{ entry.name }}</h2>
    {{ entry.bio | raw }}
  </div>
{% endfor %}
```

This code:

- Retrieves the **staff** collection and assigns it to a variable.
- Loops through each entry in the collection.
- Renders the photo, name, and bio for each item.

### Include your collection template in a page

To display the collection on your page, include your new component in a page or layout template using

```twig
{% include 'components/staff.html' %}
```

This will render all the entries from your **staff** collection.
