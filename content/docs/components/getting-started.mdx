## Introduction

Blutui's AI components can supercharge your website development by generating pre-built sections like headers, footers, galleries, and even entire hero sections! But to maximize their potential, follow these best practices.

<Callout>
Blutui AI Components can occasionally produce code with errors.While we've minimized this risk, it's always your responsibility to ensure the generated code functions as intended within your project.

<Step>
## Focus on components, not full pages

Blutui AI Components excels at creating individual website components.

```
Create an our team section component
```

While generating entire single-page websites is possible, you might need to adjust the code based on your project structure (cut-and-paste certain sections).

## Leverage Canopy for effortless editing

While the AI tool can populate your components with text/images etc, using Canopy, Blutui's built-in editor, is a faster and more efficient way to add or edit content.

Open your Blutui project on [Canopy](https://help.blutui.com/dashboard/site-dashboard/canopy/canopy-overview) and edit away.

## Specificity is key for styling

The more detailed you are about your styling needs, the better the AI can tailor the generated code to your exact vision. Be as verbose as possible.

```
Create a page component which is a hero section that has a faded-out background, we have text and buttons on the left side and 2 images on the right with slight offset at the top on where the image starts the 2 images are https://cdn.blutui.com/uploads/stride_echoes/rc-1.webp and https://cdn.blutui.com/uploads/stride_echoes/rc-2.webp. I want the text to be old-time roman as title and serif for everything else. Make the text black and the buttons black with white text and no roundness, Make the layout a grid-based where the text side takes 2 columns and the images take 1 column each and have a gap between.
```

Don't need a whole component in one prompt? Simply iterate over your chat and regenerate the code.
