### Syntax Highlighting

It's better than not having syntax highlighting.

### Autocomplete

This uses your courier.json file to get collection handles. These handles will come up in a html file when using `entry.` or `item.`. Just make sure that you set the collection to be `entry` or `item` so it would work.

Also with auto complete open and closing brackets `{% %}`, `{{ }}` and `{# #}`
