## How to edit headings

Canopy allows for easy editing of headings through their user-friendly interface.

### Here's how to get started

{% step title="Locate the Heading" position="1" %}
Find the heading you want to modify on your page. Canopy uses visual cues like highlighted areas or bounding boxes to show editable content.

Alternatively, you can also employ one of the following methods to locate your editable items.

- Click the **Toggle Guides** button to visually highlight all editable regions on the page.
- Utilize the **Component Tree** to navigate and identify the specific text element within the page structure.

{% /step %}

Click on the heading you want to edit.

{% step title="Edit in the Sidebar" position="3" %}
Once selected, a sidebar will appear on the right side of the interface. This sidebar will display the editing options for the chosen heading element.

**Element:** Choose the desired heading level from the dropdown menu. The options include `<h1>`,`<h2>`, all the way down to `<h6>`.

**Value:** Enter the text you want to display in the heading within the textbox.

{% callout type="note" %}
While Canopy's editor allows selecting heading tags `<h1>|<h2>` etc from a dropdown, this functionality might be overridden if your project utilizes **Tailwind CSS**
{% /callout %}

{% step title="Make Your Changes" position="4" %}
Simply modify the content directly within the sidebar. The changes will be reflected in real-time on the actual page, allowing you to preview your edits as you go. When you're happy with the changes click on **Update** to save the changes.
