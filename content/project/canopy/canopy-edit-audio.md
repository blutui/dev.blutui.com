## How to edit audio files

Canopy's user-friendly interface makes editing audio files a smooth process.

### Here's how to get started

{% step title="Locate the Audio" position="1" %}
Identify the audio file you want to edit on your page. Canopy uses visual indicators like highlighted areas or bounding boxes to show editable elements.

Alternatively, you can also employ one of the following methods to locate your editable items.

- Click the **Toggle Guides** button to visually highlight all editable regions on the page.
- Utilize the **Component Tree** to navigate and identify the specific audio element within the page structure.

{% step title="Edit in the Sidebar" position="3" %}
Once selected, a sidebar will appear on the right side of the interface. This sidebar will display the editing options for the chosen audio element.

**Type:** Enter the MIME type of your audio file in this textbox.

Common audio formats include:

- audio/mpeg (MP3)
- audio/wav (WAV)
- audio/ogg (Ogg)

It's important to choose the appropriate MIME type for your audio file to ensure proper playback across different browsers.

**URL:** Enter the complete web address (URL) of your audio file in this textbox.
