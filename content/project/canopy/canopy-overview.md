Canopy is Blutui's in-page editor designed to streamline the website creation process. It empowers developers to construct the website's structure and content managers to edit pages directly within the interface.

### Content management

Canopy fosters a collaborative workflow between developers and content managers. Developers can leverage **tags** within their code to designate specific areas editable through Canopy. This establishes clear separation between the codebase and content, allowing content managers to modify website copy without needing to touch the code.
