## How to edit lists

Canopy's user-friendly interface makes editing lists a straightforward process.

### Here's how to get started

{% step title="Locate the List" position="1" %}
Identify the list you want to edit on your page. Canopy uses visual indicators like highlighted areas or bounding boxes to show editable elements.

Alternatively, you can also employ one of the following methods to locate your editable items.

- Click the **Toggle Guides** button to visually highlight all editable regions on the page.
- Utilize the **Component Tree** to navigate and identify the specific text element within the page structure.

{% step title="Edit in the Sidebar" position="3" %}
Once selected, a sidebar will appear on the right side of the interface. This sidebar will display the editing options for the chosen list element.

**Type:** Choose between Bulleted List and Numbered List.

**Adding and Editing List Items**

- Locate the **Add list item** button. Clicking this button adds a new blank line for entering your list item content.

- Enter the text you want to display for each list item directly in the corresponding line.

- To edit an existing list item, simply select the text within that item and make your changes.

**Reordering List Items:** Use the Up Arrow and Down Arrow icons to move the selected item up or down within the list.

Simply modify the content directly within the sidebar. The changes will be reflected in real-time on the actual page, allowing you to preview your edits as you go. When you're happy with the changes click on **Update** to save the changes.
