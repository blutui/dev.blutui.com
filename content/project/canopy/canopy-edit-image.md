## How to edit images

Canopy's user-friendly interface makes editing images a breeze.

### Here's how to get started

{% step title="Locate the Image" position="1" %}
Identify the image you want to edit on your page. Canopy uses visual indicators like highlighted areas or bounding boxes to show editable elements.

Alternatively, you can also employ one of the following methods to locate your editable items.

- Click the **Toggle Guides** button to visually highlight all editable regions on the page.
- Utilize the **Component Tree** to navigate and identify the specific text element within the page structure.

{% step title="Edit in the Sidebar" position="3" %}
Once selected, a sidebar will appear on the right side of the interface. This sidebar will display the editing options for the chosen image element.

**URL:** Enter the complete web address (URL) of the image you want to display in this textbox. Ensure the URL is accurate and the image is publicly accessible.

**Alternative text:** Provide alternative text for the image in this textbox.

{% step title="Make Your Changes" position="4" %}
Simply modify the content directly within the sidebar. The changes will be reflected in real-time on the actual page, allowing you to preview your edits as you go. When you're happy with the changes click on **Update** to save the changes.
