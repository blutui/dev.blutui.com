### Publish or Delete a Blog
At the top right hand side of the page you will find the blue `Publish` button and the button with the three dots. Clicking on the `Publish` button will allow you to publish your blog post to your site. Please make sure that the timezone of your site is correctly set in the site settings so you know that your blog will publish at the correct date and time for your specific timezone. 

If you click on the button with the three dots, this will pull up two options; 1. Delete Post and 2. Back to blogs. When you click `Delete Post`, a confirmation dialogue will come up to confirm your decision. Clicking on `back to blogs` will redirect you to the landing page of the blogs tab.
