The Blutui Console API requires a Blutui [access tokens](https://console.blutui.com/profile) to authenticate requests. API requests made without the correct access token will return a `401` error. Requests using a valid access token but with insufficient permissions will return a `403` error.

Here's how to authenticate with an access token using cURL:

```bash title="Example request with bearer token"
curl https://api.blutui.com/v1/agencies/studio/brand \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ey....'
```

To keep the platform secure, developers need to request specific [access scopes](#) during the authorization process. It is recommended that you only request as much data access as your application needs to work.
