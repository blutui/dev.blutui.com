## Introduction

When a user submits a form, you may want to redirect them to a **thank-you page**, **confirmation screen**, or any other route in your project.  
Blutui makes this easy — simply add a hidden `redirect` field inside your form.

This guide will show you how to set up a form redirect in just a few lines.

---

### 1. Wrap your form with the form tags

First, ensure your form is created using the Canvas form tag:

```canvas
{% form 'contact' %}
  {# Form elements go here #}
{% endform %}
````

Replace `contact` with the handle of the form you created in the dashboard.

If you need help creating a form, view the [How do I make a form in a Blutui project?](/guides/create-form) guide.

---

### 2. Add the redirect field

Inside your `{% form %}` block, add a hidden input named `redirect`:

```canvas
{% form 'contact' %}

  <input type="hidden" name="redirect" value="/contact/thank-you">

{% endform %}
```

The `value` is the page you want the user to be taken to after the form is submitted.

In this example:

```
/contact/thank-you
```

This means the user will be redirected to the **thank-you page** once the form is processed.

---

### 3. Make sure the redirect page exists

The redirect will only work if the target page exists.

If you need help creating a page, follow the [How do I create a page?](/guides/create-page) guide.

## Example structure

Here is a full example of a contact form with a redirect:

```canvas
{% form 'contact' %}
  <input type="hidden" name="redirect" value="/contact/thank-you">

  {% for field in form.fields %}
    {{ ui.field(field) }}
  {% endfor %}

  <button type="submit">Send</button>
{% endform %}
```
