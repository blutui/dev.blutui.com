title: How do I expand page content using collection data?
description: Learn how to use collections to extend and enrich your page content — for example, adding author details to blog posts.

## Introduction

In this guide, you’ll learn how to **extend your page or blog content** using **collection data**.  
We’ll walk through an example of expanding a blog post to include detailed author information such as an avatar, name, and bio — all managed through a collection.

This approach allows you to connect different types of content and make your pages more dynamic and data-driven.

---

### 1. Create an Authors collection

Start by creating a new **collection** in your project dashboard.

1. Navigate to the **Collections** section in your Blutui dashboard.  
2. Click **Create collection** and name it `Authors`.  
3. Add the following fields:

| Field Type | Name | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| Text | handle | A unique identifier for each author (e.g. `frodo-baggins`) |
| Text | Author Name | The display name of the author |
| File | avatar | The author’s profile image |
| Richtext | bio | A short author biography |


After saving the collection, create your first entry:

| Field | Example Value |
|--------|----------------|
| handle | `frodo-baggins` |
| Author Name | Frodo Baggins |
| avatar | *(upload an image)* |
| bio | “Ring-bearer and adventurer from the Shire.” |

---

### 2. Reference the author in a blog post

Next, open one of your blog posts (or create a new one) and fill in the **author** field with the author’s handle — in this case:

```

frodo-baggins

````

This will link the blog post to the matching entry in your `Authors` collection.

---

### 3. Connect the author data in your template

Now, let’s connect your blog post to its author data inside your Canvas template.

At the top of your blog post template, set and filter the collection to find the correct author:

```canvas
{% set authors = cms.collection('authors') %}
{% set author = authors | filter(v => v.handle == post.author) | first %}
````

This retrieves the `authors` collection and filters it by the `handle` value matching the blog post’s `author` field.

---

### 4. Display the author information

Once you’ve set the author variable, you can display the author’s details anywhere in your post template.
Typically, this is shown at the bottom of the blog post.

```canvas
<div class="author-section">
  <img
    src="{{ author.avatar }}"
    alt="{{ author.name }}"
  >
  <p>
    <strong>{{ author.name }}</strong>
  </p>
  <div>
    {{ author.bio | raw }}
  </div>
</div>
```

This will render the author’s avatar, name, and biography directly from the collection data.

### 5. Extend this approach further

You can use this same pattern to expand your pages with other types of related content, such as:

* Linking **locations** to events
* Displaying **categories** or **tags** for posts
* Showing **related products** or **team members** based on handles or URLs

By using collections, you can connect data across your site and make your content more flexible and scalable.
