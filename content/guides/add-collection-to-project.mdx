## Introduction

Now that you’ve set up your content, navigation menu, and editable pages, you may want to add **dynamic data-driven content** — things like products, staff members, locations, or galleries.

This is where **Blutui Collections** come in.  
Collections allow you to define reusable data structures using a wide range of field types, making it easy to create dynamic, flexible content that can be managed directly from the dashboard.

### 1. Create a basic collection

Like most content types in Blutui, everything begins in your **project dashboard**.

1. Open your project in the **Blutui dashboard**.
2. Navigate to the **Collections** section using the sidebar.
3. Click **Create collection** to start a new one.

When creating a collection, you’ll define the fields that will hold your content data.  
For this example, let’s add three fields:

- **Text** — for the staff member’s name
- **Textarea** — for their bio or description
- **Image** — for their profile picture

<img
  alt="Creating a collection in Blutui"
  src="https://cdn.blutui.com/uploads/assets/Dev/guides/collection.png"
  width="800"
  height="450"
/>

Each field requires a **Name**, which is how you’ll reference it in your templates later.

### 2. Create a template for your collection

Once your collection is set up, you can display it on your site using a Canvas template.

In this example, let’s say our collection’s **handle** is `staff`.

1. Inside your project’s `views` directory, create a new folder called `components` (if it doesn’t already exist).
2. Inside it, create a file named `staff.html`.

Your file structure should look like this:

```
views/
└── components/
    └── staff.html
```

Now open `staff.html` and add the following Canvas code:

```canvas
{% set collection = cms.collection('staff') %}

{% for entry in collection %}
  <div>
    <img src="{{ entry.image }}" alt="{{ entry.name }}" />
    <h2>{{ entry.name }}</h2>
    {{ entry.bio | raw }}
  </div>
{% endfor %}
```

This code:

- Retrieves the `staff` collection and assigns it to a variable.
- Loops through each entry in the collection.
- Renders the image, name, and role for each item.

### 3. Include your collection template in a page

To display the collection on your page, include your new component in a page or layout template using the `{% include %}` tag:

```canvas
{% include 'components/staff.html' %}
```

This will render all the entries from your `staff` collection wherever you place the include.

## Next steps

You can extend this approach to display any type of data — such as galleries, products, testimonials, or store locations. Collections give you full control over how your content is structured and presented.
