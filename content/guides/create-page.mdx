## Introduction

Now it’s time to create a page for your Blutui project.  
There are two ways to do this:

1. Create a page directly inside the **`pages`** directory of your project.
2. Create and manage the page through the **Blutui dashboard** using a layout.

Both approaches work, but creating and managing pages from the **dashboard** offers greater flexibility, allowing you to edit content, control visibility, and manage metadata without touching code.  
This guide will focus on creating a page from the dashboard.

## Creating a page

<Steps>
<Step>
## Ensure you have a layout

Before creating a page, make sure you’ve set up a layout.  
Follow this guide to create your first layout:
[How do I create a layout?](/guides/create-layout)

</Step>

<Step>
## Go to the Pages section in your project dashboard

Open your project in the **Blutui dashboard** and navigate to the **Pages** section.  
Click **Add Page** to create a new one.

</Step>

<Step>
## Configure your page details

You’ll see a form with several options to configure your page:

![Add Page](https://cdn.blutui.com/uploads/assets/Dev/guides/add-page.png)

- **Name** — The internal name for your page.
- **URL** — The public address where your page can be accessed.
- **Meta title** and **Meta description** — Used for SEO and search results.
- **Publish date & time** — Schedule when your page goes live.
- **Layout** — Select a layout template from your `layouts` folder.

If your desired layout doesn’t appear, make sure you’ve run:

```bash
courier push
```

or have `courier dev` running locally to sync your layout files.

</Step>

<Step>
###  Save and preview your page

Once you’ve filled out the details and selected a layout, save your page.
You can now visit your page using the URL you defined in the form.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Next steps

Now that your page is created and visible, it’s time to make it editable by adding **Canopy elements** to your layout.
This allows content editors to update text, images, and other components directly from the dashboard.
