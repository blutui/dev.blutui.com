Just like `courier pull`, Courier also includes a command to push your files to your Blutui project. Once you have finished making file changes to your project, run the following command to push the entire project to a staging environment:

```bash
courier push
```

Once the project has successfully been pushed, run the following command to open the staging environment in your browser:

```bash
courier open
```
