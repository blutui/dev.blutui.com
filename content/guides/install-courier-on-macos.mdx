## Introduction

Courier is a development tool that allows you to write code locally and view the results instantly. Once you're satisfied with your work, you can push it to your Blutui project for review. Courier is designed to offer the best of both worlds by integrating local workflow with the cloud, thereby making development faster, more enjoyable, and more creative. This guide outlines the steps to install and set up Courier on a macOS machine.

## Prerequisites

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.
- Administrative access for local setup and cloud connectivity.

## Installation

<Steps>
<Step>
### Add the Courier Homebrew Tap
Firstly, open your terminal and run the following command to install Courier:

```bash
brew install --cask blutui/courier/courier
```

Courier will require administrative access for running projects locally and connecting to Blutui.
</Step>

<Step>
### Verify the installation
Lastly, to confirm that Courier is successfully installed, run:

```bash
courier
```

This will display a list of available commands, confirming Courier is now successfully installed.

## Additional steps for Firefox users

If you're using Firefox, you'll need to install Network Security Services (NSS):

brew install nss
```
</Step>
