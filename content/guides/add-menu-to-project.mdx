## Introduction

Now that you know how to create pages, it’s time to connect them with a **navigation menu**.  
Menus help users explore your site and are managed directly from your project dashboard.

### 1. Create a navigation menu

1. Open your project in the **Blutui dashboard**.
2. Navigate to the **Menus** section using the sidebar.
3. Click **Create menu** in the top-right corner of the page.
4. Give your new menu a **Name**, add your desired items, and set a **Handle**.

The **Handle** is used to reference your menu in your Canvas templates.

### 2. Create a header component

To display your menu across multiple pages, it’s best to place it inside a reusable **header component**.

1. Inside your project’s `views` directory, create a folder called `components` (if it doesn’t exist).
2. Inside that folder, create a file named `header.html`.

Your structure should look like this:

```
views/
└── components/
    └── header.html
```

Now open `header.html` and add the following Canvas code:

```canvas
{% set menu = cms.menu('main') %}

<header>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      {% for item in menu.items %}
        <li>
          <a href="{{ item.href }}">{{ item.label }}</a>

          {% if item.items %}
            <ul>
              {% for subitem in item.items %}
                <li>
                  <a href="{{ subitem.href }}">{{ subitem.label }}</a>
                </li>
              {% endfor %}
            </ul>
          {% endif %}
        </li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
```

This code:

- Fetches the menu with the handle `main`.
- Loops through each menu item and displays it as a list.
- Checks for submenus (nested items) and renders them using a nested loop.

### 3. Include your header in a layout

Once your header component is ready, you can include it in your main layout file (for example, `templates/default.html`) so it appears on every page.

Open your layout file and include the component inside the `<body>` tag, typically above your `{% block body %}`:

```canvas
{% include 'components/header' %}

{% block body %}{% endblock %}
```

This makes the navigation menu part of your site’s shared structure.

### Extra tip

If your menu includes **submenus**, each item’s children can be accessed using `item.items`.
Simply loop through these nested items (as shown above) to display dropdowns or secondary navigation lists.

## Next steps

You can now customise your navigation’s HTML and styling to match your site design.
Menus can also be combined with active-state highlighting, dropdown styling, or responsive toggle menus.
