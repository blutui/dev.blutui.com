title: How do I use the Blutui image optimizer?
description: Learn how to optimise and transform images in Blutui using the image_url filter or direct CDN parameters.

## Introduction

Blutui provides a powerful built-in image optimizer that allows you to convert and resize images on the fly.  
You can transform images into multiple formats — **PNG, JPEG, WebP, AVIF, GIF** — and adjust dimensions for better performance and faster loading times.

There are two ways to optimise images:

1. Using the `image_url` filter  
2. Adding transformation parameters directly to the CDN URL  

Both options produce fast, optimized images served through the Blutui CDN.

### 1. Using the `image_url` filter

The easiest and most common way to optimise an image in your Canvas templates is with the `image_url` filter.

**Example:**

```canvas
{{ entry.image | image_url({ width: 280, format: 'webp' }) }}
````

This outputs a CDN-optimized image URL such as:

```
https://cdn.blutui.com/uploads/project/image.png?format=webp&width=280
```

You can adjust many properties, including:

* `format` — `webp`, `avif`, `jpeg`, `png`, `gif`
* `width` — resize width
* `height` — resize height
* `fit` — crop behaviour (cover, contain, etc.)

For full configuration options, see the official filter documentation:
[https://dev.blutui.com/docs/canvas/filters/image_url](https://dev.blutui.com/docs/canvas/filters/image_url)

### 2. Adding parameters directly to the CDN URL

You can also optimise images by adding query parameters **directly to the CDN image link**.

For example:

```
?format=jpeg
?width=600
?height=700
```

To combine transformations, just add an `&`:

```
?format=jpeg&width=600
```

This method works even outside of Canvas templates — inside CSS, JS, or anywhere you are outputting a raw image URL.

### Why optimise images?

Optimising images is one of the simplest ways to:

* Improve page load speed
* Reduce total data usage
* Improve image delivery across all devices
* Increase performance scores (Lighthouse, PageSpeed, Web Vitals)

Format conversion (like WebP or AVIF) can dramatically reduce file size while keeping image quality high.

Now that you know how to optimise your images, you can apply these transformations throughout your project to significantly improve performance.
