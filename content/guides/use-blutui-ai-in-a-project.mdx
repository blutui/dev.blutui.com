## Introduction

Blutui AI Components accelerates the development of your Blutui site by enabling you to generate custom components. This facilitates easy editing within Canopy, Blutui's site editing interface.

## Prerequisites

- [A Blutui project set up and ready to go](https://dev.blutui.com/docs/getting-started/create)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://dev.blutui.com/guides/use-tailwind-css-in-a-project)

## Getting started

step title="Access Blutui AI Components" position="1" %}

- Navigate to [Blutui AI Components](https://blutui.ai).
- If you don't have an account, create a Blutui login by signing up on the AI app.

/step %}

step title="Generate Components" position="2" %}

Once logged in, you can start typing the description of the component you want to generate in the **Generate Component** textbox.

Optionally, you can choose a component from the available bubbles.

You can keep refining your component until you are happy with it.

/step %}

step title="View UI or Code for Each Iteration" position="4" %}

After each iteration, you have the option to view either the visual representation of the component or its code.

![UI and Code buttons](https://cdn.blutui.com/uploads/assets/Dev/guides/ai-components/v2-3.png)

Click on the **UI** button to preview the component's appearance based on the latest changes.
Click on the **Code** button to see the updated code, which you can copy and integrate directly into your Blutui project.
This allows you to toggle between the component's look and its code at every stage, making customization simple and intuitive.

/step %}

step title="Edit the Code in Real-Time" position="5" %}

![Code editing](https://cdn.blutui.com/uploads/assets/Dev/guides/ai-components/v2-4.png)

When you click on the **Code** button, you can directly edit the component’s code. Any changes you make will instantly update the UI preview on the left side of your screen, allowing you to see your adjustments in real time.
Once you're satisfied with the modifications, click **Save Changes** to keep them.

If you decide not to apply the changes, you can simply choose **Discard** to revert to the previous version.
This feature gives you full control over fine-tuning the component’s design and functionality.
