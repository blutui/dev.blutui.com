title: How do I link two collections?
description: Learn how to connect two collections in Blutui so you can reuse shared content without duplicating data.

## Introduction

Now that you know how to create collections, you may want to **link one collection to another**.  
This allows you to reuse existing content instead of duplicating it across multiple collections.

In this guide, we’ll walk through linking a **Locations** collection to a **Staff** collection.  
This will allow each staff entry to reference a location dynamically based on entries in the Locations collection — all managed through the dashboard.

---

### 1. Create and prepare your collections

For this example, you should have:

- A **Locations** collection (e.g., Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch)
- A **Staff** collection

If you haven't created these yet, do that first.

---

### 2. Add a link field in your collection settings

Blutui allows you to link collections directly from the dashboard — no code required.

1. Open the **Locations** collection in your project dashboard.
2. Click **Manage links**.
3. Click **New link**.
4. Select the field you want to link (e.g., a `location` reference).
5. Give your link a **Name** — just like naming a field type.

This creates a relationship between collections so you can easily reference entries from one collection inside another.

---

### 3. Access linked collection values in Canvas

Once a link has been created, you can access it from your Canvas templates in two ways:

#### Option A — Access via `foreign_keys`

```canvas
{{ entry.foreign_keys.location }}
```

This is the canonical way to retrieve linked collection values.

#### Option B — Access directly from the entry object _(shortcut)_

```canvas
{{ entry.location }}
```

> **Note:**
> This shortcut only works if your entry does **not** already have a `location` field defined.
> If you already have a field called `location`, always use the `foreign_keys` version.

---

### Example Use Case

If your **Staff** collection has a linked `location`, you can display it like this:

```canvas
<div class="staff-member">
  <h2>{{ entry.name }}</h2>
  <p>Based in: {{ entry.location.name }}</p>
</div>
```

Or using the full foreign key reference:

```canvas
<p>Based in: {{ entry.foreign_keys.location.name }}</p>
```

This allows you to update and manage locations in **one** place — the Locations collection — while automatically updating all linked Staff entries.

## Why link collections?

Linking collections helps you:

- Avoid duplicated data
- Maintain consistency across related content
- Scale content without rewriting it
- Manage shared data (like locations, categories, authors, services, products, etc.) in one place

It’s one of the most powerful features for building flexible, data-driven sites in Blutui.

You can now try linking more collections — such as categories, tags, teams, or related products — and build powerful relational content structures.
