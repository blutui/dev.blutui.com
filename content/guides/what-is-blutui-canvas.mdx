### Starting with the basics
After following the [how to pull a project onto your machine using Courier](/guides/pull-project-with-courier) guide, you will find yourself with a basic template known as a Canvas. Within this template, you will notice:

### Delving into the Canvas file structure
While the Canvas is designed to be flexible to accommodate various workflows, there are certain mandatory folders:

- `public`:
  - **Purpose**: Houses the project's public assets.
  - **Contents**: This is where you'll find and store your CSS, JS, and image files. Everything here is directly accessible via a web browser.
- `views`:
  - **Purpose**: Dedicated to your project's `.html` or `.canvas` template files.
  - **Contents**: All files in this directory are crucial for the Blutui platform, as they determine how your client's project will be rendered.
