## Introduction

A **layout** is a reusable template that defines the structure of a page. You can create unique layouts for individual pages or use them to maintain consistency across similar types of content, such as blog posts or managed pages.

Layouts make it easy to combine structured design with editable content, giving you control over how elements appear while allowing site editors to manage content visually in the dashboard.

## Creating a layout

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create a `layouts` folder

In your project’s `views` directory, create a new folder called **`layouts`**.  
This directory will hold all your layout templates.

</Step>

<Step>
### Add a new layout file

Inside the `layouts` folder, create a new HTML or Canvas file.  
Name it based on its structure or purpose—for example:

```bash
about.html
long-text-bottom-image.html
```

This naming helps you identify each layout at a glance.

</Step>

<Step>
### Extend the default template

Inside your new layout file, begin by extending your site’s base template:

```canvas
{% extends 'templates/default' %}

{% block body %}
  {# Your layout code goes here #}
{% endblock %}
```

All content for your layout should be placed within the `{% block body %}` section.

</Step>

<Step>
### Push your layout to Blutui

Once saved, push your new layout to Blutui by running:

```bash
courier push
```

If you’re already running `courier dev`, your layout will automatically sync with your local environment.

</Step> 
</Steps>
