title: How do I use route patterns in my project?
description: Learn how to use route patterns in Blutui to dynamically generate pages from collections, such as individual team member profiles.

## Introduction

Route patterns allow you to create **dynamic URLs** that render content based on your collections.  
They’re perfect for building templates like individual **team member**, **product**, or **blog post** pages — without needing to manually create each page.

In this guide, we’ll walk through how to use a route pattern to dynamically display a team member’s profile page based on their name.

---

### 1. Create a layout for your route pattern

Before you create a route pattern, you’ll need a **layout** that will render your dynamic content.

In this example, we’ll build a route pattern for **team members**.  
Start by creating a layout named:

```
team-member.html

```

This layout will be used to render each team member’s details when their unique URL is visited.

---

### 2. Create a route pattern in your dashboard

1. Open your project in the **Blutui dashboard**.  
2. Navigate to **Settings → Route Patterns**.  
3. Click **Create route pattern**.

In this example, we’ll set the route pattern to:

```
/team/{name}

````

Now configure the pattern parts:

- Click the **String** button and name it `team`.  
- Click the **Slug** button and name it `name`.  
- Select your **team-member layout** as the layout to render.  
- Click **Create route pattern**.

This pattern tells Blutui to render the `team-member.html` layout whenever a URL matches `/team/{name}` — for example, `/team/darth-vader`.

---

### 3. Add logic to your layout

Next, open your `team-member.html` layout and add the following code:

```canvas
{% set members = cms.collection('team') %}
{% set member = members | filter(entry => (entry.name | slug) == route.data.name) | first %}
````

Here’s what this code does:

* Fetches the **team** collection.
* Filters the collection by comparing the **slugified name** of each team member with the `{name}` value from the route pattern.
* Sets the matching entry as `member`.

This means that when you visit a URL like `/team/darth-vader`, Blutui will:

1. Take `darth-vader` from the URL.
2. Match it against the slugged name field in your team collection.
3. Render the `team-member` layout using that specific entry’s data.

---

### 4. Display the collection data

Now that the matching team member is set, you can render their details anywhere in the layout:

```canvas
<div class="team-member">
  <img src="{{ member.avatar }}" alt="{{ member.name }}">
  <h1>{{ member.name }}</h1>
  <p>{{ member.bio }}</p>
</div>
```

This will dynamically populate the page with each team member’s unique information.

---

### Why use route patterns?

Route patterns are incredibly powerful for creating **data-driven pages** without manually adding routes or pages.
They’re ideal for:

* Products (`/products/{id}`)
* Locations (`/locations/{city}`)
* Team members (`/team/{name}`)

With route patterns, your content scales automatically as you add new entries to your collections.

## Next steps

Now that you’ve set up a route pattern, try expanding it with related collections, or use nested route patterns for more advanced structures (e.g., `/{region}/{slug}`).
