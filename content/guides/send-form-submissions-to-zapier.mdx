## Introduction

Webhooks can be triggered whenever specific events occur in your Blutui Project. You must have access to the project dashboard to create webhooks. For example you can configure a webhook to trigger whenever a form is submitted on a project.

In this guide we'll learn how to subscribe to the `form.submission.created` event and send a webhook request to [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/webhook). You can use Zapier to automate your Blutui project workflows by sending form submission to a Google Sheet, Slack, Mailchimp, and much more.

## Prerequisites

- [Paid Zapier plan](https://zapier.com/pricing) to use the Webhooks Zap.
- Admin access to a Blutui Project.
- A pre-built form on your Blutui Project.
