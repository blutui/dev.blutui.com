## Introduction

Blutui makes it easy to create a fully functional blog with a dedicated **blog index page** and individual **blog post pages**.  
In this guide, we’ll walk through:

- Creating blog layouts  
- Setting up a blog in the dashboard  
- Rendering blog posts  
- Displaying individual post content  
- Using example Canvas code for both pages  

By the end, you’ll have a working blog system with automatic routing and dynamic content.

---

### 1. Create your blog layouts

Start by creating two layouts inside your project:

```bash
views/layouts/blogs/
├─ index.html   # Blog list page
└─ post.html    # Individual blog post page
```

If you plan to have multiple blogs with different designs, you can create folders such as:

```bash
views/layouts/news/
views/layouts/events/
```

Each blog can have its own index and post layouts.

---

### 2. Create a blog in the dashboard

1. Open your project in the **Blutui dashboard**.  
2. Navigate to the **Blogs** section.  
3. Click **Create new blog**.  
4. Set the **URL**, **Name**, and select the two layouts you created:

- **Index layout** → `layouts/blogs/index.html`
- **Post layout** → `layouts/blogs/post.html`

Save the blog.

---

### 3. Create your first blog post

Inside the blog you just created, click **Add Post**.

Add:

- Title  
- Publish date  
- Description  
- Author  
- Cover image (optional)  
- Content  

This gives you a post to render while you build your templates.

---
### 4. Set up your layouts

Both `index.html` and `post.html` must extend your default template.  
For more information about layouts, read the [How do I create a layout](https://dev.blutui.com/guides/create-layout) guide.

---

### 5. Rendering the blog index (index.html)

On the blog index page, you can access the `blog` object.  
This gives you everything you need to list posts:

```json
{
  "name": "News",
  "slug": "news",
  "uri": "/news",
  "description": null,
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": "f55baa72-5be5-43f5-9063-d2b35559c900",
      "title": "Post 1",
      "slug": "/post--b5mpy-",
      "publish_date": "2025-06-09T13:52:38.000000Z",
      "author": "Fred",
      "description": "Description",
      "cover_image": null,
      "content": "<p>This is a post</p>"
    }
  ],
  "post_count": 1
}
```

Now you can loop through all blog posts and display them:

```canvas
<div>
  <h1>{{ blog.name }}</h1>

  <div>
    {% for post in blog.posts
       | sort((a, b) => b.publish_date <=> a.publish_date)
       | reverse 
    %}
      <div>
        <img src="{{ post.cover_image }}" alt="{{ post.title }}">
        <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
        <p>{{ post.description }}</p>
        <p>{{ post.publish_date | date('d M Y') }}</p>
        <p>{{ post.author }}</p>
        <p>{{ post.content | reading_time }} reading time</p>
        <a href="{{ post.slug }}">Read more</a>
      </div>
    {% endfor %}
  </div>
</div>
```

This:

* Displays the blog’s name
* Loops through all posts
* Sorts by publish date
* Shows title, description, author, reading time, and cover image

---

### 6. Rendering individual posts (post.html)

Inside the post layout, the `post` object is available automatically.

Here’s a simple example:

```canvas
<div>
  <h1>{{ post.title }}</h1>

  <h3>{{ post.description }}</h3>

  <p>{{ post.publish_date | date('d M Y') }}</p>
  <p>{{ post.author }}</p>
  <p>{{ post.content | reading_time }} reading time</p>

  <img src="{{ post.cover_image }}" alt="{{ post.title }}">

  <div>
    {{ post.content | raw }}
  </div>
</div>
```

Notes:

* `post.content | raw` is the full post body
* Make sure your styles apply to elements inside the post body (paragraphs, headings, images, lists, etc.)

---

### 7. Routing is automatic

You **do not need** any route patterns.
Blutui blogs automatically route to the correct page.

---

### Extra tip: Add meta tags

If you're using the [meta and title tags guide](https://dev.blutui.com/guides/add-meta-and-title), you automatically get sensible defaults:

You automatically get sensible defaults:

* Post title
* Post description

It’s recommended to set the **OpenGraph image** to the blog post’s cover image:

```canvas
{% block meta %}
  {% include 'components/meta' with { image: post.cover_image } %}
{% endblock %}
```
