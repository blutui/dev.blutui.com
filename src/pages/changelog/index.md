### New Protocol template

Today we're happy to announce the launch of our new Protocol template, a meticulously crafted documentation template tuned for API references.

Powered by MDX, we've sweat all the nitty-gritty details to make sure the authoring experience is an awesome one, letting you focus on just writing great API docs, not the tooling around it.

### New Spotlight template

Today we're pumped to announce the launch of our new Spotlight template, a personal website so nice you'll actually be inspired to publish on it.

Built with Tailwind CSS and Next.js, it includes everything you need to get a personal website up-and-running, including a blog, projects page, dark mode, and more. And as always, it's been designed and built by the Tailwind CSS team.
