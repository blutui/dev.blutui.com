## Introduction

Courier is a development tool that allows you to write code locally and view the results instantly. Once you're satisfied with your work, you can push it to your Blutui project for review. Courier is designed to offer the best of both worlds by integrating local workflow with the cloud, thereby making development faster, more enjoyable, and more creative. This guide outlines the steps to install and set up Courier on a macOS machine.

## Prerequisites

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.
- Administrative access for local setup and cloud connectivity.

## Installation

```
{% /step %}

{% step title="Install Courier" position="2" %}

brew install courier
```

Courier will require administrative access for running projects locally and connecting to Blutui.

## Additional steps for Firefox users

If you're using Firefox, you'll need to install Network Security Services (NSS):
