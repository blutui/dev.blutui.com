## Introduction

Starting a project on Blutui is a simple process that offers customisation and a streamlined development experience. This guide will lead you through the essential steps to successfully create your very own Blutui project.

## Getting started

{% step title="Accessing the Console" position="1" %}
Navigate to what is commonly known as the agency dashboard or simply, the [Agency Console](https://console.blutui.com).
{% /step %}

{% step title="Initiating a new project" position="2" %}
From the **Projects** screen, click on the **Create project** button. You'll be prompted to give your project a name. For demonstration purposes, let's name it "Learning Blutui".
{% /step %}

{% step title="Additional project settings" position="3" %}
An optional **More options** button is available if you wish to expand the project details. Here, you can provide a description and even set the timezone for the project. However, for this guide, we'll skip these and note that they can be revisited and edited later.

Conclude this step by clicking on the **Create project** button. It's a quick process, and once completed, a newly crafted project page will be displayed to you.
{% /step %}

{% step title="Navigating to the Project dashboard" position="4" %}
Once your project is created, click on the **Project dashboard** button. This action will direct you to your project's staging dashboard.
{% /step %}

{% step title="Previewing Your Project" position="5" %}
Get a visual feel of your project by clicking on the **Preview** button located at the bottom left of the sidebar. You'll be shown a basic project template, inclusive of [Courier](/docs/courier/getting-started) instructions similar to what you encountered in the earlier steps.
{% /step %}

{% step title="Returning to the Dashboard" position="6" %}
To head back to the project's dashboard, simply click on the 'Dashboard' button found at the bottom corner.
{% /step %}

## Conclusion

You've done it! With these easy steps, you've created a site on Blutui. Now you're ready to begin your development journey and make the project truly your own. Happy building!
