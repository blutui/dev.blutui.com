Courier provides developers with a development environment to easily preview file changes on your local machine.

Run the following command from your Blutui project to start watching for file changes and preview them at `https://localhost:8080`:

```bash
courier dev
```

{% callout type="check" %}
Your project should should automatically open in a browser window for [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080).
{% /callout %}

To stop the developement server, press `Ctrl + C` on your keyboard to end the process.
