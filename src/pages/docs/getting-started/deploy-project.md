Now that you have built your project, it's time to add your domain(s) to it.

1. Go to your Agency Console.

2. From the projects menu, click on **Domains** from the project settings.

3. Click Add domain.

4. Enter your domain name (e.g., www.your-domain.com).

5. Click Add domain.

{% callout type="note" %}
After adding your domain, reload the page to view the newly added domain in your list.
{% /callout %}

Now you need to verify the ownership of your newly added domain(s):

Click on the more options (ellipsis menu) next to your domain and select **View** to see your domain details.

You will find a **How to** button. Click this button for a full list of instructions on how to add the necessary DNS records to your domain management console with your domain host.

Once you have added the DNS records on your domain, the process after this point is automated. Your domain's status will automatically turn green once connected, depending on your DNS provider's speed. Once your domain is connected, Blutui will automatically create an SSL certificate to keep your project secure.

## Publish your site

Once you are happy with the changes to your project, you can publish your site to make it live.

From the Project overview page, click the **Publish** button.
