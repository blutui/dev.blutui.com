## Folder Structure

After you've successfully set up your project using Blutui `Courier`, you'll discover a well-organized set of folders within your project directory. Understanding this layout is essential for efficiently creating and updating your Blutui website. Lets look at the folder structure of our example `burgertorium` project.

At the top level, your Blutui project primarily contains two folders:

```bash
burgertorium/
├── public
└── views/
    ├── pages
    ├── templates
    ├── layouts (create as needed)
    └── ... create custom directories (e.g., components)
```

- **`public`:**
  This folder houses the compiled, production-ready version of your code. This is what Blutui serves to display your website to visitors. You typically won't directly edit files within this folder, as they are generated by your build processes (e.g., when you run `courier dev` or `courier push`).

- **`views`:**
  This is where the core of your Blutui front-end logic resides. All your development work – your Blutui `components`, `pages`, `templates`, and `layouts` – will primarily take place within this folder.

## Diving Deeper into the `views` Folder

The `views` folder is further organized into three key sub-folders, each serving a distinct purpose in building your website:

- ### `pages`

  This folder is where you create and store the individual, unique pages of your website. Each file within `pages` typically corresponds to a specific address or section on your live site (like your homepage, an "About Us" section, or a "Contact" page). This is where you'll define the specific content and look for each distinct part of your Blutui website.

- ### `layouts`

  The `layouts` folder is ideal for creating a consistent visual framework around pages where the overall design needs to stay the same, but the main content within that framework changes. This is perfect for maintaining a cohesive look across a series of similar pages.

  Learn more about how to use layouts in the [Blutui Layouts documentation]().

- ### `templates`

  The `templates` folder is designed for reusable pieces of design or structure that you want to apply across multiple parts of your site. It helps you keep a consistent look and feel without repeating code.
  By default, you'll often find:
  - **`default.html`**: This acts as a common starting outline for most of your website's pages. It typically defines the very basic structure of a web page (like the overall container or where common sections such as a header or footer should go) and can include shared elements like site-wide styles. Most of your individual pages will build upon this default foundation.
  - **`404.html`**: This is a special template that displays the "Page Not Found" message to visitors if they try to access a page on your website that doesn't exist.

  You have the flexibility to create your own custom templates in this folder. This is incredibly useful if you have certain design elements or page structures you want to apply consistently in various places, which saves you time and ensures your site looks unified.

## See It in Action: The Burgertorium Example Project

To get a practical understanding of how this folder structure is used in a real-world scenario and how all these parts work together, we highly recommend exploring the **Blutui starter project: Burgertorium**. This project, built with the `tailwind-js` Canvas, serves as an excellent working example of how to leverage Blutui's organized architecture to build a functional and well-structured website.

You can find Burgertorium in the [Blutui starter project GitHub repository](https://github.com/blutui/burgertorium).
