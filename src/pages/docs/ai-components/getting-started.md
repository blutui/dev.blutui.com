## Introduction

Blutui's AI components can supercharge your website development by generating pre-built sections like headers, footers, galleries, and even entire hero sections! But to maximize their potential, follow these best practices.

{% step title="Focus on Components, Not Full Pages" position="1" %}

Blutui AI Components excels at creating individual website components.

While generating entire single-page websites is possible, you might need to adjust the code based on your project structure (cut-and-paste certain sections).

{% step title="Leverage Canopy for Effortless Text Editing" position="2" %}

While the AI tool can populate your components with text/images etc, using Canopy, Blutui's built-in editor, is a faster and more efficient way to add or edit content.

Open your Blutui project on [Canopy](https://help.blutui.com/dashboard/site-dashboard/canopy/canopy-overview) and edit away.

{% step title="Specificity is Key for Styling" position="3" %}
The more detailed you are about your styling needs, the better the AI can tailor the generated code to your exact vision. Be as verbose as possible.

{%prompt%}
Create a page component which is a hero section that has a faded-out background, we have text and buttons on the left side and 2 images on the right with slight offset at the top on where the image starts the 2 images are https://cdn.blutui.com/uploads/stride_echoes/rc-1.webp and https://cdn.blutui.com/uploads/stride_echoes/rc-2.webp. I want the text to be old-time roman as title and serif for everything else. Make the text black and the buttons black with white text and no roundness, Make the layout a grid-based where the text side takes 2 columns and the images take 1 column each and have a gap between.
