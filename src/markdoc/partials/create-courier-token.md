Before you can start using **Courier**, you will need to obtain a Courier token:

1. From your **Agency Console**, navigate to your profile by clicking on your avatar in the top right corner, then `Edit my profile`.
2. Navigate to the `Apps` section from the sidebar.
3. Click the `Create token` button on the right-hand side.
4. Give your new Courier token a name, something like "Work MacBook", then click `Create`.
5. Your Courier token will be shown for use later on. Remember to store the token securely, it is only shown once.
