The Blutui Admin API is built on **REST** principles. We enforce **HTTPS** in every request to improve data security and privacy. The API does not support **HTTP**.

All requests contain the following base URL, where `handle` is your project's handle:

```text {% process=false filename="Admin API Base URL" %}
https://{handle}.blutui.com/admin/api
```
